# Auction Helper

Simple web app which purpose to analyze statistics data from Allegro services and make life easier for sellers.
 
## Backend

Whole backend application was written in Java with Spring, data was stored in Elasticsearch (disclaimer, don't use Spring data elasticsearch, it sucks, trust me it is really lame, just stick with rest api)

## Frontend

Frontend was created in angular.js with help of bootstrap and highcharts for plotting. Whole code for frontend is localised on branch 'develop-frontend'
